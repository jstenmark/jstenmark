╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Seems a computer engineer, a systems analyst, and a programmer were       │
│ driving down a mountain when the brakes gave out.  They screamed down the │
│ mountain, gaining speed, but finally managed to grind to a halt, more by  │
│ luck than anything else, just inches from a thousand foot drop to jagged  │
│ rocks.  They all got out of the car:                                      │
│         The computer engineer said, "I think I can fix it."               │
│         The systems analyst said, "No, no, I think we should take it      │
│ into town and have a specialist look at it."                              │
│         The programmer said, "OK, but first I think we should get back    │
│ in and see if it does it again."                                          │
