│ I went to my first computer conference at the New York Hilton about 20   │
│ years ago.  When somebody there predicted the market for microprocessors │
│ would eventually be in the millions, someone else said, "Where are they  │
│ all going to go? It's not like you need a computer in every doorknob!"   │
│ Years later, I went back to the same hotel.  I noticed the room keys had │
│ been replaced by electronic cards you slide into slots in the doors.     │
│ There was a computer in every doorknob.                                  │
