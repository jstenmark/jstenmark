│     This is where the bloodthirsty license agreement is supposed to go,      │
│ explaining that Interactive Easyflow is a copyrighted package licensed for   │
│ use by a single person, and sternly warning you not to pirate copies of it   │
│ and explaining, in detail, the gory consequences if you do.                  │
│     We know that you are an honest person, and are not going to go around    │
│ pirating copies of Interactive Easyflow; this is just as well with us since  │
│ we worked hard to perfect it and selling copies of it is our only method of  │
│ making anything out of all the hard work.                                    │
│     If, on the other hand, you are one of those few people who do go         │
│ around pirating copies of software you probably aren't going to pay much     │
│ attention to a license agreement, bloodthirsty or not.  Just keep your doors │
│ locked and look out for the HavenTree attack shark.                          │
