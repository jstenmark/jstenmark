│ You are transported to a room where you are faced by a wizard who       │
│ points to you and says, "Them's fighting words!"  You immediately get   │
│ attacked by all sorts of denizens of the museum: there is a cobra       │
│ chewing on your leg, a troglodyte is bashing your brains out with a     │
│ gold nugget, a crocodile is removing large chunks of flesh from you, a  │
│ rhinoceros is goring you with his horn, a sabre-tooth cat is busy       │
│ trying to disembowel you, you are being trampled by a large mammoth, a  │
│ vampire is sucking you dry, a Tyrannosaurus Rex is sinking his six inch │
│ long fangs into various parts of your anatomy, a large bear is          │
│ dismembering your body, a gargoyle is bouncing up and down on your      │
│ head, a burly troll is tearing you limb from limb, several dire wolves  │
│ are making mince meat out of your torso, and the wizard is about to     │
│ transport you to the corner of Westwood and Broxton.  Oh dear, you seem │
│ to have gotten yourself killed, as well.                                │
