│     A manager went to his programmers and told them: "As regards to your      │
│ work hours: you are going to have to come in at nine in the morning and leave │
│ at five in the afternoon."  At this, all of them became angry and several     │
│ resigned on the spot.                                                         │
│     So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own        │
│ working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule."  The         │
│ programmers, now satisfied, began to come in a noon and work to the wee       │
│ hours of the morning.                                                         │
