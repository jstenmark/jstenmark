│     Risch's decision procedure for integration, not surprisingly,            │
│ uses a recursion on the number and type of the extensions from the           │
│ rational functions needed to represent the integrand.  Although the          │
│ algorithm follows and critically depends upon the appropriate structure      │
│ of the input, as in the case of multivariate factorization, we cannot        │
│ claim that the algorithm is a natural one.  In fact, the creator of          │
│ differential algebra, Ritt, committed suicide in the early 1950's,           │
│ largely, it is claimed, because few paid attention to his work.  Probably    │
│ he would have received more attention had he obtained the algorithm as well. │
