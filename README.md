│ Unix Beer: Comes in several different brands, in cans ranging from 8 oz.  │
│ to 64 oz.  Drinkers of Unix Beer display fierce brand loyalty, even       │
│ though they claim that all the different brands taste almost identical.   │
│ Sometimes the pop-tops break off when you try to open them, so you have   │
│ to have your own can opener around for those occasions, in which case you │
│ either need a complete set of instructions, or a friend who has been      │
│ drinking Unix Beer for several years.                                     │
│     BSD stout: Deep, hearty, and an acquired taste.  The official         │
│ brewer has released the recipe, and a lot of home-brewers now use it.     │
│     Hurd beer: Long advertised by the popular and politically active      │
│ GNU brewery, so far it has more head than body.  The GNU brewery is       │
│ mostly known for printing complete brewing instructions on every can,     │
│ which contains hops, malt, barley, and yeast ... not yet fermented.       │
│     Linux brand: A recipe originally created by a drunken Finn in his     │
│ basement, it has since become the home-brew of choice for impecunious     │
│ brewers and Unix beer-lovers worldwide, many of whom change the recipe.   │
│     POSIX ales: Sweeter than lager, with the kick of a stout; the         │
│ newer batches of a lot of beers seem to blend ale and stout or lager.     │
│     Solaris brand: A lager, intended to replace Sun brand stout.          │
│ Unlike most lagers, this one has to be drunk more slowly than stout.      │
│     Sun brand: Long the most popular stout on the Unix market, it was     │
│ discontinued in favor of a lager.                                         │
│     SysV lager: Clear and thirst-quenching, but lacking the body of       │
│ stout or the sweetness of ale.                                            │
│                                                                           │
