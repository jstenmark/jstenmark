│     *** DO YOU HAVE A RESTLESS URGE TO PROGRAM? ***                            │
│ Do you want the instant respect that comes from being able to use technical    │
│ terms that nobody understands?  Do you want to strike fear and loathing into   │
│ the hearts of DP managers everywhere?  If so, then let the Famous Programmers' │
│ School lead you on... into the world of professional computer programming.     │
│     *** IS PROGRAMMING FOR YOU? ***                                            │
│ Programming is not for everyone.  But, if you have the desire to learn, we can │
│ help you get started.  All you need is the Famous Programmers' Course and      │
│ enough money to keep those lessons coming month after month.                   │
│     *** TAKE OUR FREE APTITUDE TEST ***                                        │
│ To help determine if you are qualified to be a programmer, take a moment to    │
│ try this simple test:                                                          │
│     (1) Write down the numbers from zero to nine and the first six letters     │
│         of the alphabet (Hint: 0123456789ABCDEF).                              │
│     (2) Whose picture is on the back of a twenty-dollar bill?                  │
│     (3) What is the state capital of Idaho?                                    │
│ If you managed to read all three questions without wondering why we asked      │
│ them, you may have a future as a computer programmer.                          │
