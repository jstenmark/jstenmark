│     A novice asked the master: "I have a program that sometimes runs and      │
│ sometimes aborts.  I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am totally │
│ baffled. What is the reason for this?"                                        │
│     The master replied: "You are confused because you do not understand       │
│ the Tao.  Only a fool expects rational behavior from his fellow humans.  Why  │
│ do you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed?  Computers      │
│ simulate determinism; only the Tao is perfect.                                │
│     The rules of programming are transitory; only the Tao is eternal.         │
│ Therefore you must contemplate the Tao before you receive enlightenment."     │
│     "But how will I know when I have received enlightenment?" asked the       │
│ novice.                                                                       │
│     "Your program will then run correctly," replied the master.               │
