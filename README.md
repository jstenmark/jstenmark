│ `Lasu' Releases SAG 0.3 -- Freeware Book Takes Paves For New World Order │
│ by staff writers                                                         │
│     ...                                                                  │
│     The SAG is one of the major products developed via the Information   │
│ Superhighway, the brain child of Al Gore, US Vice President.  The ISHW   │
│ is being developed with massive govenment funding, since studies show    │
│ that it already has more than four hundred users, three years before     │
│ the first prototypes are ready.  Asked whether he was worried about the  │
│ foreign influence in an expensive American Dream, the vice president     │
│ said, ``Finland?  Oh, we've already bought them, but we haven't told     │
│ anyone yet.  They're great at building model airplanes as well.  And _I │
│ can spell potato.''  House representatives are not mollified, however,   │
│ wanting to see the terms of the deal first, fearing another Alaska.      │
│     Rumors about the SAG release have imbalanced the American stock      │
│ market for weeks.  Several major publishing houses reached an all time   │
│ low in the New York Stock Exchange, while publicly competing for the     │
│ publishing agreement with Mr. Wirzenius.  The negotiations did not work  │
│ out, tough.  ``Not enough dough,'' says the author, although spokesmen   │
│ at both Prentice-Hall and Playboy, Inc., claim the author was incapable  │
│ of expressing his wishes in a coherent form during face to face talks,   │
│ preferring to communicate via e-mail.  ``He kept muttering something     │
│ about jiffies and pegs,'' they say.                                      │
│     ...                                                                  │
