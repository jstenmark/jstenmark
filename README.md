│ [From the operation manual for the CI-300 Dot Matrix Line Printer, made      │
│ in Japan]:                                                                   │
│ The excellent output machine of MODEL CI-300 as extraordinary DOT MATRIX     │
│ LINE PRINTER, built in two MICRO-PROCESSORs as well as EAROM, is featured by │
│ permitting wonderful co-existence such as; "high quality against low cost,"  │
│ "diversified functions with compact design," "flexibility in accessibleness  │
│ and durability of approx. 2000,000,00 Dot/Head," "being sophisticated in     │
│ mechanism but possibly agile operating under noises being extremely          │
│ suppressed" etc.                                                             │
│ And as a matter of course, the final goal is just simply to help achieve     │
│ "super shuttle diplomacy" between cool data, perhaps earned by HOST          │
│ COMPUTER, and warm heart of human being.                                     │
