│     In the east there is a shark which is larger than all other fish.  It     │
│ changes into a bird whose winds are like clouds filling the sky.  When this   │
│ bird moves across the land, it brings a message from Corporate Headquarters.  │
│ This message it drops into the midst of the programmers, like a seagull       │
│ making its mark upon the beach.  Then the bird mounts on the wind and, with   │
│ the blue sky at its back, returns home.                                       │
│     The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands    │
│ it not.  The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears   │
│ its message.  The master programmer continues to work at his terminal, for he │
│ does not know that the bird has come and gone.                                │
