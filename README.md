│     The salesman and the system analyst took off to spend a weekend in the    │
│ forest, hunting bear.  They'd rented a cabin, and, when they got there, took  │
│ their backpacks off and put them inside.  At which point the salesman turned  │
│ to his friend, and said, "You unpack while I go and find us a bear."          │
│     Puzzled, the analyst finished unpacking and then went and sat down        │
│ on the porch.  Soon he could hear rustling noises in the forest.  The noises  │
│ got nearer -- and louder -- and suddenly there was the salesman, running like │
│ hell across the clearing toward the cabin, pursued by one of the largest and  │
│ most ferocious grizzly bears the analyst had ever seen.                       │
│     "Open the door!", screamed the salesman.                                  │
│     The analyst whipped open the door, and the salesman ran to the door,      │
│ suddenly stopped, and stepped aside.  The bear, unable to stop, continued     │
│ through the door and into the cabin.  The salesman slammed the door closed    │
│ and grinned at his friend.  "Got him!", he exclaimed, "now, you skin this     │
│ one and I'll go rustle us up another!"                                        │
