╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ A certain monk had a habit of pestering the Grand Tortue (the only one who   │
│ had ever reached the Enlightenment 'Yond Enlightenment), by asking whether   │
│ various objects had Buddha-nature or not.  To such a question Tortue         │
│ invariably sat silent.  The monk had already asked about a bean, a lake,     │
│ and a moonlit night.  One day he brought to Tortue a piece of string, and    │
│ asked the same question.  In reply, the Grand Tortue grasped the loop        │
│ between his feet and, with a few simple manipulations, created a complex     │
│ string which he proferred wordlessly to the monk.  At that moment, the monk  │
│ was enlightened.                                                             │
│ From then on, the monk did not bother Tortue.  Instead, he made string after │
│ string by Tortue's method; and he passed the method on to his own disciples, │
│ who passed it on to theirs.                                                  │
