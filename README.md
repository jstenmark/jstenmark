│ Ever wondered about the origins of the term "bugs" as applied to computer     │
│ technology?  U.S. Navy Capt. Grace Murray Hopper has firsthand explanation.   │
│ The 74-year-old captain, who is still on active duty, was a pioneer in        │
│ computer technology during World War II.  At the C.W. Post Center of Long     │
│ Island University, Hopper told a group of Long Island public school adminis-  │
│ trators that the first computer "bug" was a real bug--a moth.  At Harvard     │
│ one August night in 1945, Hopper and her associates were working on the       │
│ "granddaddy" of modern computers, the Mark I.  "Things were going badly;      │
│ there was something wrong in one of the circuits of the long glass-enclosed   │
│ computer," she said.  "Finally, someone located the trouble spot and, using   │
│ ordinary tweezers, removed the problem, a two-inch moth.  From then on, when  │
│ anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it."  Hopper      │
│ said that when the veracity of her story was questioned recently, "I referred │
│ them to my 1945 log book, now in the collection of the Naval Surface Weapons  │
│ Center, and they found the remains of that moth taped to the page in          │
│ question."                                                                    │
│         [actually, the term "bug" had even earlier usage in                   │
│         regard to problems with radio hardware.  Ed.]                         │
