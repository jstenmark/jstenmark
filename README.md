│ ***** Special AI Seminar (abstract)                                             │
│ It has been widely recognized that AI programs require expert knowledge         │
│ in order to perform well in complex domains.  But knowledge alone is not        │
│ sufficient for some applications; wisdom is needed as well.  Accordingly,       │
│ we have developed a new approach to artificial intelligence which we call       │
│ "wisdom engineering".  As a test of our ideas, we have written IMMANUEL, a      │
│ wisdom based system for the task domain of western philosophical thought.       │
│ IMMANUEL was supplied initially with 200 wisdom units which contained wisdom    │
│ about such elementary concepts as mind, matter, being, nothingness, and so      │
│ forth.  IMMANUEL was then allowed to run freely, guided by the heuristic        │
│ rules contained in its heterarchically organized meta wisdom base.  IMMANUEL    │
│ succeeded in rediscovering most of the important philosophical ideas developed  │
│ in western culture over the course of the last 25 centuries, including those    │
│ underlying Plato's theory of government, Kant's metaphysics, Nietzsche's theory │
│ of value, and Husserl's phenomenology.  In this seminar, we will describe       │
│ IMMANUEL's achievements and internal architecture.  We will also briefly        │
│ discuss our recent efforts to apply wisdom engineering to oil exploration.      │
