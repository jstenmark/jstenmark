│     A programmer from a very large computer company went to a software        │
│ conference and then returned to report to his manager, saying: "What sort     │
│ of programmers work for other companies?  They behaved badly and were         │
│ unconcerned with appearances. Their hair was long and unkempt and their       │
│ clothes were wrinkled and old. They crashed out hospitality suites and they   │
│ made rude noises during my presentation."                                     │
│     The manager said: "I should have never sent you to the conference.        │
│ Those programmers live beyond the physical world.  They consider life absurd, │
│ an accidental coincidence.  They come and go without knowing limitations.     │
│ Without a care, they live only for their programs.  Why should they bother    │
│ with social conventions?"                                                     │
│     "They are alive within the Tao."                                          │
