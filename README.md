│     Hardware met Software on the road to Changtse.  Software said: "You        │
│ are the Yin and I am the Yang.  If we travel together we will become famous    │
│ and earn vast sums of money."  And so the pair set forth together, thinking    │
│ to conquer the world.                                                          │
│     Presently, they met Firmware, who was dressed in tattered rags, and        │
│ hobbled along propped on a thorny stick.  Firmware said to them: "The Tao      │
│ lies beyond Yin and Yang.  It is silent and still as a pool of water.  It does │
│ not seek fame, therefore nobody knows its presence.  It does not seek fortune, │
│ for it is complete within itself.  It exists beyond space and time."           │
│     Software and Hardware, ashamed, returned to their homes.                   │
