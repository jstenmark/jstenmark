│     *** A NEW KIND OF PROGRAMMING ***                                          │
│ Do you want the instant respect that comes from being able to use technical    │
│ terms that nobody understands?  Do you want to strike fear and loathing into   │
│ the hearts of DP managers everywhere?  If so, then let the Famous Programmers' │
│ School lead you on... into the world of professional computer programming.     │
│ They say a good programmer can write 20 lines of effective program per day.    │
│ With our unique training course, we'll show you how to write 20 lines of code  │
│ and lots more besides.  Our training course covers every programming language  │
│ in existence, and some that aren't.  You'll learn why the on/off switch for a  │
│ computer is so important, what the words *fatal error* mean, and who and what  │
│ you should blame when you make a mistake.                                      │
│     Yes, I want the brochure describing this incredible offer.                 │
│     I enclose  is small unmarked bills to cover the cost of               │
│     postage and handling. (No live poultry, please.)                           │
│ *** Our Slogan:  Top down programming for the masses. ***                      │
