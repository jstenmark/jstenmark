│ As in Protestant Europe, by contrast, where sects divided endlessly into      │
│ smaller competing sects and no church dominated any other, all is different   │
│ in the fragmented world of IBM.  That realm is now a chaos of conflicting     │
│ norms and standards that not even IBM can hope to control.  You can buy a     │
│ computer that works like an IBM machine but contains nothing made or sold by  │
│ IBM itself.  Renegades from IBM constantly set up rival firms and establish   │
│ standards of their own.  When IBM recently abandoned some of its original     │
│ standards and decreed new ones, many of its rivals declared a puritan         │
│ allegiance to IBM's original faith, and denounced the company as a divisive   │
│ innovator.  Still, the IBM world is united by its distrust of icons and       │
│ imagery.  IBM's screens are designed for language, not pictures.  Graven      │
│ images may be tolerated by the luxurious cults, but the true IBM faith relies │
│ on the austerity of the word.                                                 │
