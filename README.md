│     There once was a man who went to a computer trade show.  Each day as     │
│ he entered, the man told the guard at the door:                              │
│     "I am a great thief, renowned for my feats of shoplifting.  Be           │
│ forewarned, for this trade show shall not escape unplundered."               │
│     This speech disturbed the guard greatly, because there were millions     │
│ of dollars of computer equipment inside, so he watched the man carefully.    │
│ But the man merely wandered from booth to booth, humming quietly to himself. │
│     When the man left, the guard took him aside and searched his clothes,    │
│ but nothing was to be found.                                                 │
│     On the next day of the trade show, the man returned and chided the       │
│ guard saying: "I escaped with a vast booty yesterday, but today will be even │
│ better."  So the guard watched him ever more closely, but to no avail.       │
│     On the final day of the trade show, the guard could restrain his         │
│ curiosity no longer. "Sir Thief," he said, "I am so perplexed, I cannot live │
│ in peace.  Please enlighten me.  What is it that you are stealing?"          │
│     The man smiled.  "I am stealing ideas," he said.                         │
