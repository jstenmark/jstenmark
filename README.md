│     A master programmer passed a novice programmer one day.  The master        │
│ noted the novice's preoccupation with a hand-held computer game.  "Excuse me", │
│ he said, "may I examine it?"                                                   │
│     The novice bolted to attention and handed the device to the master.        │
│ "I see that the device claims to have three levels of play: Easy, Medium,      │
│ and Hard", said the master.  "Yet every such device has another level of play, │
│ where the device seeks not to conquer the human, nor to be conquered by the    │
│ human."                                                                        │
│     "Pray, great master," implored the novice, "how does one find this         │
│ mysterious setting?"                                                           │
│     The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it under foot.     │
│ And suddenly the novice was enlightened.                                       │
