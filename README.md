│ The misnaming of fields of study is so common as to lead to what might be    │
│ general systems laws.  For example, Frank Harary once suggested the law that │
│ any field that had the word "science" in its name was guaranteed thereby     │
│ not to be a science.  He would cite as examples Military Science, Library    │
│ Science, Political Science, Homemaking Science, Social Science, and Computer │
│ Science.  Discuss the generality of this law, and possible reasons for its   │
│ predictive power.                                                            │
