│ disclaimer: tough.  We reserve the right to do the absolute minimum provided │

│     This is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software       │
│ packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese.            │
│     We didn't really want to include any disclaimer at all, but our          │
│ lawyers insisted.  We tried to ignore them but they threatened us with the   │
│ attack shark at which point we relented.                                     │
