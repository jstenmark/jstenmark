╭─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ ... an anecdote from IBM's Yorktown Heights Research Center.  When a            │
│ programmer used his new computer terminal, all was fine when he was sitting     │
│ down, but he couldn't log in to the system when he was standing up.  That       │
│ behavior was 100 percent repeatable: he could always log in when sitting and    │
│ never when standing.                                                            │
│ Most of us just sit back and marvel at such a story; how could that terminal    │
│ know whether the poor guy was sitting or standing?  Good debuggers, though,     │
│ know that there has to be a reason.  Electrical theories are the easiest to     │
│ hypothesize: was there a loose wire under the carpet, or problems with static   │
│ electricity?  But electrical problems are rarely consistently reproducible.     │
│ An alert IBMer finally noticed that the problem was in the terminal's keyboard: │
│ the tops of two keys were switched.  When the programmer was seated he was a    │
│ touch typist and the problem went unnoticed, but when he stood he was led       │
│ astray by hunting and pecking.                                                  │
