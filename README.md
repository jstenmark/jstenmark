│     THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #16: C-                           │
│ This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he        │
│ submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is best │
│ described as a "low-level" programming language.  In fact, the language      │
│ generally requires more C- statements than machine-code statements to        │
│ execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very similar to COBOL.         │
