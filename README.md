│     A novice asked the master: "In the east there is a great tree-structure   │
│ that men call 'Corporate Headquarters'.  It is bloated out of shape with      │
│ vice-presidents and accountants.  It issues a multitude of memos, each saying │
│ 'Go, Hence!' or 'Go, Hither!' and nobody knows what is meant.  Every year new │
│ names are put onto the branches, but all to no avail.  How can such an        │
│ unnatural entity exist?"                                                      │
│     The master replies: "You perceive this immense structure and are          │
│ disturbed that it has no rational purpose.  Can you not take amusement from   │
│ its endless gyrations?  Do you not enjoy the untroubled ease of programming   │
│ beneath its sheltering branches?  Why are you bothered by its uselessness?"   │
│         -- Geoffrey James, "The Tao of Programming"                           │
