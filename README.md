│ Only the fittest survive. The vanquished acknowledge their unworthiness by     │
│ placing a classified ad with the ritual phrase "must sell -- best offer,"      │
│ and thereafter dwell in infamy, relegated to discussing gas mileage and lawn   │
│ food.  But if successful, you join the elite sodality that spends hours        │
│ unpurifying the dialect of the tribe with arcane talk of bits and bytes, RAMS  │
│ and ROMS, hard disks and baud rates. Are you obnoxious, obsessed?  It's a      │
│ modest price to pay.  For you have tapped into the same awesome primal power   │
│ that produces credit-card billing errors and lost plane reservations.  Hail,   │
│ postindustrial warrior, subduer of Bounceoids, pride of the cosmos, keeper of  │
│ the silicone creed: Computo, ergo sum.  The force is with you -- at 110 volts. │
│ May your RAMS be fruitful and multiply.                                        │
