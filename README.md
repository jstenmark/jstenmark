│     The Magician of the Ivory Tower brought his latest invention for the       │
│ master programmer to examine.  The magician wheeled a large black box into the │
│ master's office while the master waited in silence.                            │
│     "This is an integrated, distributed, general-purpose workstation,"         │
│ began the magician, "ergonomically designed with a proprietary operating       │
│ system, sixth generation languages, and multiple state of the art user         │
│ interfaces.  It took my assistants several hundred man years to construct.     │
│ Is it not amazing?"                                                            │
│     The master raised his eyebrows slightly. "It is indeed amazing," he        │
│ said.                                                                          │
│     "Corporate Headquarters has commanded," continued the magician, "that      │
│ everyone use this workstation as a platform for new programs.  Do you agree    │
│ to this?"                                                                      │
│     "Certainly," replied the master, "I will have it transported to the        │
│ data center immediately!"  And the magician returned to his tower, well        │
│ pleased.                                                                       │
│     Several days later, a novice wandered into the office of the master        │
│ programmer and said, "I cannot find the listing for my new program.  Do        │
│ you know where it might be?"                                                   │
│     "Yes," replied the master, "the listings are stacked on the platform       │
│ in the data center."                                                           │
