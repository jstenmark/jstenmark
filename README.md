│     It appears that after his death, Albert Einstein found himself      │
│ working as the doorkeeper at the Pearly Gates.  One slow day, he        │
│ found that he had time to chat with the new entrants.  To the first one │
│ he asked, "What's your IQ?"  The new arrival replied, "190".  They      │
│ discussed Einstein's theory of relativity for hours.  When the second   │
│ new arrival came, Einstein once again inquired as to the newcomer's     │
│ IQ.  The answer this time came "120".  To which Einstein replied, "Tell │
│ me, how did the Cubs do this year?" and they proceeded to talk for half │
│ an hour or so.  To the final arrival, Einstein once again posed the     │
│ question, "What's your IQ?".  Upon receiving the answer "70",           │
│ Einstein smiled and replied, "Got a minute to tell me about VMS 4.0?"   │
